/**
 * A group of objects that receives a shared animation state.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * - Add objects you would otherwise pass as 'root' to the
 * constructor or the .clipAction method of AnimationMixer.
 * - Instead pass this object as 'root'.
 * - You can also add and remove objects later when the mixer is running.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * - Objects of this class appear as one object to the mixer,
 * so cache control of the individual objects must be done on the group.
 *
 * Limitation:
 *
 * - The animated properties must be compatible among the all objects in the group.
 * - A single property can either be controlled through a target group or directly, but not both.
