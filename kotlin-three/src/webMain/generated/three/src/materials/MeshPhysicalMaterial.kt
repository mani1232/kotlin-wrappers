/**
 * An extension of the {@link MeshStandardMaterial}, providing more advanced
 * physically-based rendering properties:
 *
 * - Anisotropy: Ability to represent the anisotropic property of materials
 * as observable with brushed metals.
 * - Clearcoat: Some materials — like car paints, carbon fiber, and wet surfaces — require
 * a clear, reflective layer on top of another layer that may be irregular or rough.
 * Clearcoat approximates this effect, without the need for a separate transparent surface.
 * - Iridescence: Allows to render the effect where hue varies  depending on the viewing
 * angle and illumination angle. This can be seen on soap bubbles, oil films, or on the
 * wings of many insects.
 * - Physically-based transparency: One limitation of {@link Material#opacity} is that highly
 * transparent materials are less reflective. Physically-based transmission provides a more
 * realistic option for thin, transparent surfaces like glass.
 * - Advanced reflectivity: More flexible reflectivity for non-metallic materials.
 * - Sheen: Can be used for representing cloth and fabric materials.
 *
 * As a result of these complex shading features, `MeshPhysicalMaterial` has a
 * higher performance cost, per pixel, than other three.js materials. Most
 * effects are disabled by default, and add cost as they are enabled. For
 * best results, always specify an environment map when using this material.
