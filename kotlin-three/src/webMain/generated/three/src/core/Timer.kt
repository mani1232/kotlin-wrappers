/**
 * This class is an alternative to {@link THREE.Clock} with a different API design and behavior
 * The goal is to avoid the conceptual flaws that became apparent in {@link THREE.Clock} over time.
 *
 * - {@link Timer} has an {@link .update()} method that updates its internal state. That makes it possible to call
 *   {@link .getDelta()} and {@link .getElapsed()} multiple times per simulation step without getting different values.
 * - The class can make use of the Page Visibility API to avoid large time delta values when the app is inactive (e.g.
 *   tab switched or browser hidden).
 *
 * @example
 * const timer = new Timer();
 *
 * function animate(timestamp) {
 *   requestAnimationFrame(animate);
 *   // timestamp is optional
 *   timer.update(timestamp);
 *   const delta = timer.getDelta();
 *   // do something with delta
 *   renderer.render(scene, camera);
 * }
 *
 * @see https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_morphtargets_sphere
