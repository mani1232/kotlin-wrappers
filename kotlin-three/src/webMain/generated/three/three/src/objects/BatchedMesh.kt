/**
 * A special version of {@link Mesh} with multi draw batch rendering support. Use BatchedMesh if you have to render a
 * large number of objects with the same material but with different geometries or world transformations. The usage of
 * BatchedMesh will help you to reduce the number of draw calls and thus improve the overall rendering performance in
 * your application.
 *
 * If the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_multi_draw WEBGL_multi_draw extension} is not
 * supported then a less performant fallback is used.
 *
 * @example
 * const box = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
 * const sphere = new THREE.SphereGeometry( 1, 12, 12 );
 * const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );
 *
 * // initialize and add geometries into the batched mesh
 * const batchedMesh = new BatchedMesh( 10, 5000, 10000, material );
 * const boxGeometryId = batchedMesh.addGeometry( box );
 * const sphereGeometryId = batchedMesh.addGeometry( sphere );
 *
 * // create instances of those geometries
 * const boxInstancedId1 = batchedMesh.addInstance( boxGeometryId );
 * const boxInstancedId2 = batchedMesh.addInstance( boxGeometryId );
 *
 * const sphereInstancedId1 = batchedMesh.addInstance( sphereGeometryId );
 * const sphereInstancedId2 = batchedMesh.addInstance( sphereGeometryId );
 *
 * // position the geometries
 * batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( boxInstancedId1, boxMatrix1 );
 * batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( boxInstancedId2, boxMatrix2 );
 *
 * batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( sphereInstancedId1, sphereMatrix1 );
 * batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( sphereInstancedId2, sphereMatrix2 );
 *
 * scene.add( batchedMesh );
