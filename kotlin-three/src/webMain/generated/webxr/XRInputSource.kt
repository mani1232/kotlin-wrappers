/**
 * Represents an XR input source, which is any input mechanism which allows the user to perform
 * targeted actions in the same virtual space as the viewer. Example XR input sources include,
 * but are not limited to, handheld controllers, optically tracked hands, and gaze-based input
 * methods that operate on the viewer's pose. Input mechanisms which are not explicitly associated
 * with the XR device, such as traditional gamepads, mice, or keyboards SHOULD NOT be considered
 * XR input sources.
